# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Vercel Deployment

## The Problem
Vercel can't find the `app` directory because the files weren't uploaded correctly to GitHub.

## The Solution
Upload these files to your GitHub repository with the EXACT structure shown below.

## Required File Structure
```
Manuskript/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ articles/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ new/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â””â”€â”€ next.config.js
```

## Steps to Fix

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: github.com/9v33n/Manuskript
2. **Delete all existing files**
3. **Create the folder structure** exactly as shown above
4. **Upload each file** to the correct location
5. **Make sure** the `app` folder is in the root directory
6. **Commit and push** the changes
7. **Redeploy on Vercel**

## Alternative: Use the Working Demo

If you want to test immediately, use the working demo:
- Open `research-app/working-demo.html` in your browser
- This has all the functionality working with sample data

## After Fixing

Once the structure is correct, Vercel should deploy successfully and you'll have:
- âœ… Working home page
- âœ… Articles listing with categories
- âœ… Article detail pages
- âœ… Write article form
- âœ… Search and filtering
- âœ… Responsive design

The key is making sure the `app` folder is directly in the root of your GitHub repository!
